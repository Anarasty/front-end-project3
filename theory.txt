When to use JavaScript const?
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const 
unless you know that the value will change.
Use const when you declare:
- A new Array
- A new Object
- A new Function
- A new RegExp
The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
Because of this you can NOT:
- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:
- Change the elements of constant array
- Change the properties of constant object
