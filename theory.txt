When to use JavaScript const?
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const 
unless you know that the value will change.
Use const when you declare:
- A new Array
- A new Object
- A new Function
- A new RegExp
The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
Because of this you can NOT:
- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:
- Change the elements of constant array
- Change the properties of constant object

THIS IN JAVASCRIPT
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
- In an object method, this refers to the object.
- Alone, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
- In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
