const - declares a block constant   ---/
if - marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition

SYNTAX
Strings: "John Doe" 'John Doe'
Numbers: 10.50 1001

When to use JavaScript const?
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const 
unless you know that the value will change.
Use const when you declare:
- A new Array
- A new Object
- A new Function
- A new RegExp
The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
Because of this you can NOT:
- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:
- Change the elements of constant array
- Change the properties of constant object

THIS IN JAVASCRIPT
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
- In an object method, this refers to the object.
- Alone, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
- In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

JAVASCRIPT STRING METHODS
- slice(start, end) - extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
- substring(start, end) - same as slice but without negative indexes
- substr(start, end) - is similar to slice(). The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part
- replace('word1', 'word2') - replaces a specified value with another value in a string
- toUpperCase() - string is converted to upper case
- toLowerCase() - string is converted to lower case with
- concat() - joins two or more strings
- trim() - removes whitespace from both sides of a string
- padStart and padEnd - support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string
- split() - string can be converted to an array

There are 3 methods for extracting string characters:
- charAt(position) - returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string
- charCodeAt(position) - returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string
- Property access [ ]'

JAVASCRIPT STRING SEARCH METHODS
indexOf() - returns the index of (the position of) the first occurrence of a specified text in a string
lastIndexOf() - returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string
search() - searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match
match() - searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns the matches, as an Array object
includes() - returns true if a string contains a specified value
startsWith() - returns true if a string begins with a specified value, otherwise false
endsWith() - returns true if a string ends with a specified value, otherwise false
